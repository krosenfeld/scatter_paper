  abstract = {The image of the emission surrounding the black hole in the center of the Milky Way is predicted to exhibit the imprint of general
relativistic (GR) effects, including the existence of a shadow feature and a photon ring of diameter {\textasciitilde}50 \ensuremath{\mu}as. Structure on these scales can be resolved by millimeter-wavelength very long baseline interferometry. However, strong-field GR features of interest will be blurred at \ensuremath{\lambda} \ensuremath{>}= 1.3 mm due to scattering by interstellar electrons. The
scattering properties are well understood over most of the relevant range of baseline lengths, suggesting that the scattering may be (mostly) invertible. We simulate observations of a model image of Sgr A* and demonstrate that the effects of scattering can indeed be mitigated by correcting the visibilities before reconstructing the image. This technique is also applicable to Sgr A* at longer wavelengths.},

  abstract = {At radio wavelengths, scattering in the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of astronomical sources. Averaged over a scattering ensemble, the result is a blurred image of the source. However, Narayan \& Goodman (1989) and Goodman \& Narayan (1989) showed that for an incomplete average, scattering introduces refractive substructure in the image of a point source that is both persistent and wideband. We show that this substructure is quenched but not smoothed by an extended source. As a result, when the scatter-broadening is comparable to or exceeds the unscattered source size, the scattering can introduce spurious compact features into images. In addition, we derive efficient strategies to numerically compute realistic scattered images, and we present characteristic examples from simulations. Our results show that refractive substructure is an important consideration for ongoing missions at the highest angular resolutions, and we discuss specific implications for RadioAstron and the Event Horizon Telescope.},

  abstract = {Sagittarius A*, the {\textasciitilde}4 {\texttimes} 106 M sun black 
hole candidate at the Galactic center, can be studied on Schwarzschild
radius scales with (sub)millimeter wavelength very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI). We report on 1.3 mm wavelength observations of
Sgr A* using a VLBI array consisting of the JCMT on Mauna Kea, the
Arizona Radio Observatory's Submillimeter Telescope on Mt. Graham in
Arizona, and two telescopes of the CARMA array at Cedar Flat in
California. Both Sgr A* and the quasar calibrator 1924-292 were observed
over three consecutive nights, and both sources were clearly detected on
all baselines. For the first time, we are able to extract 1.3 mm VLBI
interferometer phase information on Sgr A* through measurement of
closure phase on the triangle of baselines. On the third night of
observing, the correlated flux density of Sgr A* on all VLBI baselines
increased relative to the first two nights, providing strong evidence
for time-variable change on scales of a few Schwarzschild radii. These
results suggest that future VLBI observations with greater sensitivity
and additional baselines will play a valuable role in determining the
structure of emission near the event horizon of Sgr A*.},

  volume = {238},
  issn = {0035-8711},
  abstract = {We consider the angular broadening of a point source due to the effect 
of strong scattering and analytically estimate the rms image
visibilities that would be measured by a two-element interferometer. The
analysis, which is based on thin-screen scalar diffraction theory,
confirms our earlier result that the measured visibilities depend both
on the integration time of the observations and on the bandwidth
employed. Three regimes of these parameters are identified.

For the intermediate regime, corresponding to so-called `average'
visibilities, we obtain formulae which relate the rms visibility
|Va(b)|rms on a baseline b to the power spectrum
of phase fluctuations in the scattering screen. We show that
|Va(b)|rms depends on the strength of the
scattering, the power-law index of the power spectrum, and the
magnitudes of the inner and outer scales of the spectrum.

VLBI observations of compact radio sources which are scattered by the
interstellar medium (ISM) correspond to the intermediate regime and
therefore measure average' visibilities. Our results may help in
interpreting such measurements and may provide valuable information on
electron density fluctuations in the ISM on length-scales

  abstract = {The cores of most galaxies are thought to harbour supermassive black 
holes, which power galactic nuclei by converting the gravitational
energy of accreting matter into radiation. Sagittarius A* (SgrA*), the
compact source of radio, infrared and X-ray emission at the centre of
the Milky Way, is the closest example of this phenomenon, with an
estimated black hole mass that is 4,000,000 times that of the Sun. A
long-standing astronomical goal is to resolve structures in the
innermost accretion flow surrounding SgrA*, where strong gravitational
fields will distort the appearance of radiation emitted near the black
hole. Radio observations at wavelengths of 3.5mm and 7mm have detected
intrinsic structure in SgrA*, but the spatial resolution of observations
at these wavelengths is limited by interstellar scattering. Here we
report observations at a wavelength of 1.3mm that set a size of
microarcseconds on the intrinsic diameter of SgrA*. This is less than
the expected apparent size of the event horizon of the presumed black
hole, suggesting that the bulk of SgrA* emission may not be centred on
the black hole, but arises in the surrounding accretion flow.},
